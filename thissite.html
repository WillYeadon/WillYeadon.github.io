    <p>You can make a site like this with just HTML and CSS. If you upload the .html and .CSS files to Github it will host the website for you on GitHub Pages; you can even alias the domain name to make it look more professional.
    <br><br>
    This site is constructed of a series of .html files for the different pages which containt the actual content that you are seeing (like this paragraph) and a CSS file which handles all the styling. 
    By styling I mean everything from the fonts to the position and colours of elements. You can even <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14046738/how-to-disable-css-in-browser-for-testing-purposes" target="_blank">
    turn off the CSS</a> if you wish to see what the raw .html files look like.
    <br><br>
    There are lots of online resources that show how to do this such as <a href='https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/' target="_blank">'Learn to Code HTML and CSS'</a> by Shay Howe. The process is relatively straightforward and 
    with about 10 hours work you should be able to create a site like this and understand how it works. Alternatively, you could just 
    clone my repository on GitHub and change the content. This should only take 1 hour.
