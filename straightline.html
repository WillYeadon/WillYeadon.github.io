        <h2>Short answer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to both plot some data and then use a computational method to fit a straight line.
                You can do both of these things using Python or Excel.</li>
            <li>In Excel, to plot the data highlight the requisite columns and insert a chart. Then, use LINEST to create the fit. In Python load in the data
                 using Pandas then use pyplot.plot to plot it. The curve_fit method from SciPy can then be employed to create the fit.</li>
            <li>Both LINEST and curve_fit will give you some goodness of fit measures such as r-squared. You can use this to quantify how well
                you fit describes the data.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creating a plot</h3>
        <p>This code block will load in data on the erruptions of 'Old Faithful' in Yellowstone 
            National Park and create a scatter plot. The data is loaded in using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>
            and plotted using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>. These two, along with <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>> a 
            and <a href="https://scipy.org/">SciPy</a> form a key part of the <a href="https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/python/scipy.html">Scientific Python Stack</a>.
            <br><br>    
            Once the data is loaded in, it is extracted into two Pandas series for 'X' (waiting time) and
            'y' (duration of the erruption). These Pandas series are used by the plot method of pyplot in the
            matplotlib library to create the plot. The final three lines simply add titles and labels.
        </p>
<pre><code class="python">
# import pandas and pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
            
# load our data in
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/geyser.csv')
X = data['waiting']
y = data['duration']
            
# plot our function
plt.plot(X, y, 'bo')
plt.title("Old Faithful Erruptions")
plt.xlabel('Waiting time between erruptions [Min]')
plt.ylabel('Erruption duraciton [Min]')

</code></pre>

    <p>Looking at the data you can see that in general erruption duration will go up with longer wait time between erruptions. 
        This seems quite sensible however we lack any geological theory to support why this would be the case.
        As an example, lets say that we posit that the erruption duration is directly proportional to the waiting time between erruptions potentially
        with an offset of some sort.
        <br><br>
        We can express this mathematically as y = mx + c e.g. a straight line. Given this, we can use the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html">method of least
        squares in the SciPy library</a> to fit this function. With the function fitted, next we can use <a>the r-squared functionality of Scikit-Learn</a> to
        calculate a value which characterizes the quality of the fit, in this case the r-squared value where a value of 1 equates to the best fit and
        0 the worst.

# import scipy, sklearn and numpy
from scipy import optimize
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
import numpy as np

# defining our y = mx + c function
def f(x, m, c):
    return m*x + c

# fit the function
params, covs = optimize.curve_fit(f, xdata = X, ydata = y)

# calculate r^2
y_pred = f(X, params[0], params[1])
r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)

# calculate fit line
fX = np.arange(X.min() - 5, X.max() + 5, 1)
fy = f(fX, params[0], params[1]) 

# plot fit
plt.plot(fX, fy, '-', color='k', linewidth=3.0)
plt.annotate(xy=[40, 5],
             text = 'm = {m:.2f}, c = {c:.2f}\n$r^2$ = {r:.2f}'\
             .format(m = params[0], c = params[1], r = r2),
            fontsize=12.5)
